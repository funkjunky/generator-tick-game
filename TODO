 *- setup redux store
 *- setup redux yield effect and test

 *- create call effect that also handles normal functions
 *- put thiings into their own files and import them.
 *- create tick effect

 *- fork yield effect, then update the call effect to also handle normal functions. Then make a pull request.

 *- dispatch fireball generator
 *- create the fireball action generator
 *- get it probably working

 - clean up code

 - create the graphics with shapes in canvas using RAF
	- me thick triangle green
	- enemy thick red triangle
	- conjure blue circle 1-percent diameter [gets smaller as finishing] 
	- fireball is orange circle
	- explosion is square 0.3 opacity + (Math.round(percentage * 100) % 30 / 10)

 - Advanced Logger: somehow get root dispatches from store.dispatch and create a tree from there. Tricky problem to solve
