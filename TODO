 - commit, push

 - npm link tick folder

 - Tick: switch the effect for an action, so any library can use it. Also make a function version that isn’t based on an action/middleware.

 - things don’t feel entirely encapsulated…


 - copy the code and create a seed project
 - copy the seed and create a new game!
	- ipad mini resolution
	- collect game ideas from notes to think of my first RPG


 - Advanced Logger with a tree
	~ maybe in middleware to detect generator, then pass on to effect processor that it has a parent. I would need to intercept “put” effects to add them to the tree, and add a branch to be passed on to other put effects, also tick?? Different colours for effects and actions?
