 *- put thiings into their own files and import them.

 - Graphics
	*- setup canvas element 640 480, border background color white
	*- setup RAF for canvas element on index
	*- basic graphics
	- make a little cooler [hollowed out]
		*- people thick triangle
		*- conjure blue circle 1-percent diameter [gets smaller as finishing] 
		*- explosion is square 0.3 opacity + (Math.round(percentage * 100) % 30 / 10)
	*- add health bars
	*- loop between players casting fireballs against each other
	*- maybe add a little stage and sky?

 - address yield effect library stuff

 - create various npm libraries for middlewares
 - rename repository to “effect-tick”
 - make github.io demo out of graphics
 - Greatly improve README for anyone to use
 - post on reactiflux and other places!

 - Advanced Logger with a tree
	~ maybe in middleware to detect generator, then pass on to effect processor that it has a parent. I would need to intercept “put” effects to add them to the tree, and add a branch to be passed on to other put effects, also tick?? Different colours for effects and actions?
