 ~~Finished - Basic Tick Example~~

 *- tag v0.9
 *- push tags
 *- branch develop

 - create various npm libraries for middlewares
 - rename repository to “effect-tick”
 - Greatly improve README for anyone to use
 - merge to master
 - tag v1.0
 - branch develop

 - Advanced Logger with a tree
	~ maybe in middleware to detect generator, then pass on to effect processor that it has a parent. I would need to intercept “put” effects to add them to the tree, and add a branch to be passed on to other put effects, also tick?? Different colours for effects and actions?
