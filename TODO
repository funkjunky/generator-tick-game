 ~~Finished - Basic Tick Example~~

 *- tag v0.9
 *- push tags
 *- branch develop

 *- create various npm libraries for middlewares
 *- rename repository to “effect-tick”
 *- merge to master
 *- tag v1.0
 *- branch develop
 *- Greatly improve README for anyone to use

 *- bind key to shoot fireball from me. Enemy is still automatic.

 *- add y coordinate to demo entity reducer and all actions
 *- update seek to work with y coordinate
 - add the y coordinate for graphics
 - ensure it all still works

 - add jump action
 - add movement keys and jump to my character
 - ensure it works and fireball still works
 - cancel conjure fireball if moving

 - things don’t feel entirely encapsulated…

 - Advanced Logger with a tree
	~ maybe in middleware to detect generator, then pass on to effect processor that it has a parent. I would need to intercept “put” effects to add them to the tree, and add a branch to be passed on to other put effects, also tick?? Different colours for effects and actions?
