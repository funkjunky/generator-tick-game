# generator-tick-game
A super primitive game to test using redux yield effect with a tick effect for game dev

See https://funkjunky.github.io/generator-tick-game/ for a demo

I hope to try all of the basic kinds of game mechanics using generators and redux yield effect.
Note this doesn't include graphics at all.
The idea would be that you use the store to draw your graphics when you wanted.
[In the case of the demo: drawing shapes on request animation frame]

Things tested:
 - effects before, after, or during any of the below things
 
 - projectiles (with location and speed)
 - casting time

Game Dev this appears to be inappropriate for:

 - None so far!
